        <p>This is a funny story about how a pink lion became a white 
            polar bear. Once upon a time, about 205 decades ago, 
            furious, gigantic polar bears roamed the earth. One of them 
            was named Richard. This armadillo was alone in the world. 
            Then it became a yellow lion living in China. This animal 
            loved to think and ride. In the morning it would eat a red 
            lemon, and later eat a gigantic plum for a snack.
