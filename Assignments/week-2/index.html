        <p >This is a angry story about how a yellow armadillo became a 
        pink fox. Once upon a time, about 235 minutes ago, angry, 
        gigantic tigers roamed the earth. One of them was named 
        Albert. This horse was alone in the world. Then it became a 
        pink polar bear living in Ecuador. This animal loved to 
        think and walk. In the morning it would eat a red avocado, 
        and later eat a angry orange for a snack.
